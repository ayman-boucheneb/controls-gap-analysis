# National Cyber Security Centre’s Cyber Assessment Framework

## The CAF – a tool for assessing cyber resilience
- Cyber Assessment Framework - provides an approach to assessing the extent to which cyber risks to essential functions are being managed by the organisation responsible.
- CAF-based assessment can be carried out by:
    - Self-assessment - organisation is responsible for itself
    - By an independent external entity - regulator/ cyber oversight body
    - By a qualified organisation acting on behalf of a regulator
- The NCSC CAF cybersecurity and resilience objectives and principles provide the foundations of the CAF.

## CAF requirements
- Provide a framework to support practical cyber resilience assessments.
- Ensure assessments are outcome-focused and not just tick-box exercises.
- Align with existing cybersecurity guidance and standards.
- Help identify effective cybersecurity and resilience improvements.
- Exist in a standard core version, which is sector-agnostic
- Be extensible to accommodate sector-specific elements as may be required.
- Allow organisations to set meaningful, proportionate target security levels.
- Be as straightforward and cost-effective to apply as possible.


# Objective A - Managing Security Risk
## Purpose:
- Implement appropriate structures/policies/processes/procedures in place
- Understand and manage security risks to network and data systems

## Principles:
- Governance: appropriate policies in place to govern data & network practices.
- Risk Management: Organisation takes steps to identify & assess security risks to data and network systems.
- Asset Management: Organisations must identify & understand all the systems/services/resources that support their essential functions.
- Supply Chain: Organisation must manage risks to systems & networks supporting the essential functions that arise from dependency on suppliers.



# Objective B - Protecting against cyber attacks
## Purpose:
- Proportionate security measures are in place to protect the networks and information systems supporting essential functions from cyber attack. 

## Principles:
- Service Protection Policies, Processes and Procedures: Organisation communicates & implements policies that direct procedures to secure systems and data.
- Identity and Access Control: Organisation manages access to network, and users are verified, authorised and authenticated to use it.
- Data Security: 
    - Data stored or transmitted is protected from unauthorised access or modification.
    - Authorised users access data only necessary for their operations 
- System Security: Critical systems are protected with strong security, guided by the organisation’s risk understanding to reduce opportunities for attacks.
- Resilient Networks and Systems: Resilience against cyberattacks and system failures is built into system design, operation, and management.
- Staff awareness and training: Staff are trained & know how to perform their organisational roles effectively in relation to data & network systems.


# Objective C - Detecting cyber security events
## Purpose:
- Ensuring security defences are effective and detect cybersecurity events affecting, or potential to affect, essential functions.

## Principles:
- Security Monitoring: Organisation monitors status of system to detect security events indicative of a security incident
- Threat Hunting: Organisation actively looks for hidden threats that standard security tools might miss.



# Objective D - Minimising the impact of cyber security incidents
## Purpose:
- Capabilities minimise impact of security incident on operation of essential functions.

## Principles:
- Response and Recovery Planning: Clear plans to keep services running, with backups to limit damage.
- Lessons Learned: Steps are taken to understand an incident’s causes and sure action is taken to protect against future incidents.
