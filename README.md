# Controls Gap Analysis (Mini Project)
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an **audit & assurance task**. It's a gap analysis project of the London borough of Hammersmith & Fulham Council against the official **NCSC CAF** and **ISO 27001 Annex A controls** frameworks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Understand how to apply frameworks in practice.
- Define a clear scope - systems and assests that are being audited
- Build a control matrix which compares what is in place to framework controls
- Write clear, auditor-style findings and recommendations.
- Package everything into a professional Github repository

## Frameworks used in project:
- NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework(CAF): the cybersecurity guidance of organisations in the "day-to-day life of the UK"
- International Organization for Standardisation(ISO) 27001 Annex A controls: international framework that provides security controls to perform best data security practices.
