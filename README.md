# Controls Gap Analysis (Mini Project)
## Overview
This project is an **audit & assurance task**. It's a gap analysis project of the London borough of Hammersmith & Fulham Council against the official **NCSC CAF** and **ISO 27001 Annex A controls** frameworks, to analyse how the council maanges its cybersecurity operations in comparison to the contents of both frameworks. The project simulates a real-world assurance task, producing a structured report and supporting artefacts.

## Aims & Objectives
- Understand how to apply frameworks in practice, and apply them to a real-world organisation
- Define a clear scope - systems and assests that are being audited
- Build a control matrix which compares what is in place to framework controls
- Document findings and recommendations in an auditor-style report
- Package everything into a professional Github repository

## Frameworks used in project:
- NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework(CAF): the cybersecurity guidance of organisations in the "day-to-day life of the UK"
- International Organization for Standardisation(ISO) 27001 Annex A controls: international framework that provides security controls to perform best data security practices.
